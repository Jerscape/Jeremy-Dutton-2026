    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about">I have a curious and thirsty mind. It has led me on a career journey from HR, to Non-Profit, 
      to Tech. Along the way I picked up experience and skills in Project Management, Coaching, Business Development, Training, 
      Course Development, CRM Administration, Coding, and Consulting...just to name a few. I greatly enjoy solving problem, and have a 
      knack for using faciltaiton to gain buy-in for solutions.
    
      I am passionate and committed in all that I do. If you have a problem you think I can solve, or a contribution I can make, let's talk!
